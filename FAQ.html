	<h3><p>• What is SMAS?</p></h3>
<p>SMAS is the Society of Medieval Arts and Sciences. Official, fancy name aside, we are well known as the LARP club. </p>

	<h3><p>• What is a LARP? </p></h3>
	
	<p>A LARP, or a Live Action Role Play, is an activity that involves members in physically partaking in roleplay (the act of taking on the identity of a character). This is very similar to roleplays such as D&amp;D, but add in the physical component of dressing into garb, acting out the roleplay, and physically interacting with the environment. </p>

	<h3><p>• Okay, but I’m not interested in LARPing? </p></h3>
<p>That’s okay! It is just a part of the club that we are well known for. </p>

	<h3><p>• What else does the club offer? </p></h3>
<p>SMAS offers twice a week fight practices, as well as a once a week workshop.</p>

	<h3><p>• What is fight practice? </p></h3>
<p>Fight practice is offered twice a week (currently Mondays and Thursdays) where we practice a LARP based system known as boffer combat. In simplicity, it is bonking friends with foam swords.</p>
<p>Boffers, or the foam swords, are weapons made of bamboo and pipe foam. Our boffers are made under Realms guidelines, which is talked about below.</p>
<p>The Realms boffer system that we use is a <i>lightest touch</i> system. This means that, for safety, we prioritize tapping our boffers as light as possible against others. This, alongside weapon construction guidelines, helps to make fight practice a safe environment for everyone to participate in. </p>
<p>Fight practice is ran by our coaches, who run us through a series of practices involving one on one fight, team challenges, tactics, and more to improve members’ skills. These generally run for 3 hours, but no one is required to stay for the entire time, or make any specific time. </p>

	<h3><p>• What are workshops?</p></h3>
<p>Workshops occur once a week (currently on Wednesdays) and are based on medieval and LARP topics. These workshops range from crafts to conversations, such as making chainmail, garb, or boffer weapons, and talking about Realms, medieval heraldry, and more.</p>
<p>Workshops are ran either by officers, coaches, or guest speakers. Like fight practices, no one is required to stay for the entire time, but it is recommended to join at the start of the workshop, as many workshops go in a sequential order according to the craft or conversation. </p>

# SMAS_Website
A test version of a website for SMAS (Society for Medieval Arts and Sciences) at WPI.


Most of the functionality is here, except the calendar. I'm working on it. The links all connect, and the back buttons work as proper back buttons where they should. 

Some of the style is a bit unfinished due to time constraints. Also working on it.
